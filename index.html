				<h1>Loralee Starla Gentry</h1>
				<p>I have quite the eclectic educational background.  In 2008 I started out my collegiate career at California Polytechnic State University: San Luis Obispo studying Aerospace Engineering.</p>
				<p>Although engineering was intriguing, my artistic side suffered greatly, so I went on to earn my Associate of Arts from Seattle Central Community College while I focused on finding my new educational path.</p>
				<p>Finally I enrolled at Eastern Washington University and completed the junior level of the Film program.  Now I am in my senior year at EWU studying Film, Design, and Art, headed for the field of digital media design and production upon graduation in the spring of 2015.</p>
